    # Description of the project
    Currently the design of mechanical joining processes like self-pierce riveting with 
    semi-tubular rivet (SPR-ST) and clinching for production is subject to complex and experimental test 
    series in which process parameters such as the rivet or die geometry are varied iteratively and based 
    on experience until a suitable joint contour and strength is achieved. To simplify the use of mechanical 
    joining technologies, these development cycles and thereby the effort for implementation into production must be reduced.

    ### Analytical formulas
    To predict the strength using analytical formulas, a literature review was done. Papers were found only for 
    clinch joints. When predicting the strength with analytical formulas, it is important to know that there are two dominant 
    failure mechanisms. The first dominant failure mode is fracture in the punch side sheet. The second failure mode is 
    completely dominated by plastic deformation. In this case, the clinch joint will locally deform hereby reducing the 
    interlock between both sheets eventually leading to unbuttoning of the joint. In practice, a combination of both failure modes occurs.
    The predominant failure mode of the clinch is determined by the calculated lower bound strength.

    #### Top tensile test
    The deformation process during a top tensile test can be compared with that of the **tube sinking process without a mandrel**. This implies 
    that the die-side sheet can be seen as a rigid ‘die’. The most basic formula applies when the clinch is simplified to a tube. Because of 
    oversimplification, the maximum force will be underestimated. According to Coppieters et al. [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263823111002679?casa_token=B9vJYddxRZwAAAAA:5qLzJcUV4gLqi2gJPE3CC38byUndCJ8UfmIoVFduI26Dy3b0XCoLJw55gXLHm4FdiM2AsEBYMekKXg), 
    the bottom part of the clinch contributes to the strength as it is radially compressed when assuming a rigid die (original). If the edges of the shape are more strictly delineated, 
    by means of the typical geometric parameters, an even better prediction of the force is obtained.
